			<h3>FAQ</h3>
			<details>
				<summary>What is Lorem Ipsum?</summary>
				<p>
					Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
					industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
					ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
					type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
					survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
					electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
					popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
					containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
					publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
					Lorem Ipsum.

				<summary>Why do we use it?</summary>
				<p>
					It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by
					the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The
					point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
					distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
					here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
					publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
					their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will
					uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions
					have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
					purpose (injected humour and the like).

				<summary>Where does it come from?</summary>
				<p>
					Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
					It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
					making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
					professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
					the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
					passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
					literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
					from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
					Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45
					BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
					during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem
					ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
